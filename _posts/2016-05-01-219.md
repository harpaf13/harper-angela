ETH, Zürich. Nicola is a highly distinguished theorist who has made many seminal contributions to new computational and theoretical tools for calculating the properties of complex solids and their application to the rational design and understanding of new multifunctional materials. She is a fellow of the APS, MRS and AAAS and has won numerous awards for her research and educational activities.

She has generously agreed to give a series of Masterclass lectures which will provide a unique opportunity for all LJC students and post-docs to learn about computational methods in complex solids and multiferroics. The lectures will be accessible to computational and theoretical physicists, chemists and materials scientists. All members of the LJC are welcome.
