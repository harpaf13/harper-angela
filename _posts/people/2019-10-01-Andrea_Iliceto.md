I am a PhD student in the Morris Group working in the School of Metallurgy and Materials at The University of Birmingham. During my PhD I will carry out computational based research in the field of Material Science using various approaches and tools, the main one being the DFT package CASTEP.
During my previous studies, I completed an integrated Master’s Degree at the University of York in Theoretical Physics. My Master’s dissertation project focused on atomistic spin dynamics simulations of magnetoresistive random access memory.
